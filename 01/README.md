# Day 1

> In the past year the OWASP community created an amazing project to teach OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities. Can you find it?

Click on the link at the bottom <https://owasp.si/>. These people are organizers of this CTF.

Click on Projects, we have a [SecureBank](https://github.com/ssrdio/SecureBank) project, which apparently can teach about OWASP TOP 10.

Checking branches, we have `1337` there. In [one of commits](https://github.com/ssrdio/SecureBank/commit/a0b5fff459a7a18faba3fc96d0beea58cb3aca97) on this branch, we found a flag:

```
